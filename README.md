**Replication**
In order to replicate the results, run the Python file 'Final League analysis executable script.py'

**Please note**
1. The code works for leagues of up to 50 members, however leagues below 30 members are optimal
2. Many png files will be created in the same folder as the file is running in, however they will be deleted at the end
3. **Replicate in a clean folder without any other png files** otherwise all png files in that folder will be lost when running the code
4. The PDF documents in the repository are as examples only
